# Bank of the West Coding Test

# Requirements

Create a simple REST-ful API to perform CRUD operations on a list of Bank Locations, that are stored in a .CSV file.

1. The `bank-locations.csv` data file in the `\Data` folder is your data source of Bank locations. Import that into either a local SQL database or store it in-memory (ex HTTP Cache)

2. Design and develop a REST API with various endpoints that expose the locations collection for the following operations. 
    - Get all locations
    - Get a single location
    - Delete a location
    - Create and Save a new location
    
3. Sample output of a GET operation on a `/api/locations/` endpoint, for example, should return the following data

4. Create your solution using `.Net Framework` or `.Net Core` and upload your solution to a public github repository and send the recruiter the link to it so we can review your code.

## Notes:
1. Not all the rows in `bank-locations.csv` are valid locations. You should only import and expose those rows / records that have an address, city, state and zipcode.
2. Design the various API endpoint keeping REST design priciples in mind. Ex: A DELETE on a location would use the DELETE Http VERB
3. You can create the API using either 

## Bonus:

The following is completely optional, and you can do some, all or none of these.

1. Create API documentation using Swagger
2. Populate `latitude` and `longitude` after the data import, using a geocoding api like Google Maps API.
3 Document the main classes using XML code comments
4 Write inline code comments to briefly describe the design patterns you are using.
